# PC Optimization for Gaming

- A collection of ```Tweaks.bat``` focused on optimizing overall responsiveness by improving framerate, frametimes, input and device communication latencies.
- Experimental ```Windows11Tweaks.bat``` that make the OS more responsive. Remove bloat and configure telemetry, security and privacy elements.
- Other improvements can include reducing or eliminating stutters and hitching.

> [!NOTE]
> - Enabling ```Resizable BAR``` in the BIOS depends on your hardware compatibility, motherboard manufacturer and BIOS version.
> - You can verify ```Resizable BAR``` is enabled by opening the ```NVIDIA Control Panel``` then ```System Information```, and then look for ```Resizable BAR``` in the list. If it says ```Yes```, you’re set.

## Windows Timer Resolution
- Use the Intelligent Standby List Cleaner application to force a Windows Timer Resolution
- Start this program with windows and always running in the background
- Enable ```Custome Timer Resolution```
- Enable ```GlobalTimerResolutionRequests``` [we already force enable this in the registry in ```TimerTweaks.bat```]
- Set the ```Wanted Timer Resolution``` field to a value extremely close to 0.5ms
- Use Measure Sleep application to check diagnostics for resolution, sleep and delta;

```Measure Sleep
Resolution: 0.5050ms, Sleep(n=1) slept 1.0038ms (delta: 0.0038)
Resolution: 0.5050ms, Sleep(n=1) slept 1.0040ms (delta: 0.0040)
Resolution: 0.5050ms, Sleep(n=1) slept 1.0036ms (delta: 0.0036)
Resolution: 0.5050ms, Sleep(n=1) slept 1.0042ms (delta: 0.0042)
Resolution: 0.5050ms, Sleep(n=1) slept 1.0045ms (delta: 0.0045)
Resolution: 0.5050ms, Sleep(n=1) slept 1.0041ms (delta: 0.0041)
Resolution: 0.5050ms, Sleep(n=1) slept 1.0076ms (delta: 0.0076)
Resolution: 0.5050ms, Sleep(n=1) slept 1.0033ms (delta: 0.0033)
Resolution: 0.5050ms, Sleep(n=1) slept 1.0041ms (delta: 0.0041)
Resolution: 0.5050ms, Sleep(n=1) slept 1.0045ms (delta: 0.0045)
Resolution: 0.5050ms, Sleep(n=1) slept 1.0041ms (delta: 0.0041)
Resolution: 0.5050ms, Sleep(n=1) slept 1.0031ms (delta: 0.0031)
Resolution: 0.5050ms, Sleep(n=1) slept 1.0035ms (delta: 0.0035)
Resolution: 0.5050ms, Sleep(n=1) slept 1.0033ms (delta: 0.0033)
```
  
> [!NOTE]
> - The default Windows setting is around ~15ms.
> - For my system, setting the Timer Resolution value to 0.5050 produced the best result where each sleep metric is exact/accurate to 2 decimal places - 1.00ms.
> - On your system, test different Timer Resolution values so that you achieve the lowest and most consistent sleep metric
> - Your Timer Resolution isn't optimal when you see the sleep values vary too much (spiking from 1ms to 2ms or higher)

## Message Signal Intterupts (MSI)
- Use the Interrupt Affinity Policy Tool application to define and force Message Signal Intterupts
- Assign cpu cores to separate devices where interrupts are sent to
- Assign priority level
 
| Device                  | Priority | Core Assignment    |
|-------------------------|----------|--------------------|
| GPU                     | High     | P-Cores 4,5,6,7    |
| Network Controller      | High     | P-Cores 1,2,3      |
| USB Host Controllers    | High     | P-Cores 1,2,3      |
| NVME Drives             | High     | E-cores 8-15       |
| NVME Controllers        | High     | E-cores 8-15       |

> [!NOTE]
> - Example table shows a configuartion where HyperThreading is disabled, that sets high priority and seperates intterupts individually on usable threads for all MSI enabled devices.
> - Recommended to not set intterupts on Core 0. Typically the default interrupt thread(s) for entire system. Bottleneck in many cases where OS, applications and games can default to significant usage of this core/thread(s).
